# CTN-0027: Starting Treatment with Agonist Replacement Therapies (START)
# https://ctnlibrary.org/protocol/ctn0027/


# This study demonstrated no evidence of liver damage
# during the initial 6 months of treatment with either BUP or MET,
# providing further encouragement to physicians to use buprenorphine
# as an effective treatment option for opioid addiction.

# liver damage measured by transaminase levels

# CTN-0030: Prescription Opiate Abuse Treatment Study (POATS)
# https://ctnlibrary.org/protocol/ctn0030/

# Prescription opioidâ€“dependent patients are most likely to reduce opioid use
# during buprenorphine-naloxone treatment.
# However, if tapered off buprenorphine-naloxone,
# even after 12 weeks of treatment,
# the likelihood of an unsuccessful outcome is high,
# even in patients receiving counseling in addition to standard medical management.

# CTN-0051: Extended-Release Naltrexone vs. Buprenorphine for Opioid Treatment (X:BOT)
# https://ctnlibrary.org/protocol/ctn0051/

# Participants randomized to XR-NTX had a substantial induction hurdle:
# fewer successfully initiated XR-NTX than BUP-NX,
# resulting in a higher rate of 24-week relapse events for the XR-NTX group.
# Among participants successfully inducted to treatment,
# however, 24-week relapse events were similar across study groups.
# Self-reported opioid craving was initially less with XR-NTX than with BUP-NX (p=0.0012),
# then converged by week 24 (p=0.20).
# With the exception of mild-to-moderate XR-NTX injection site reactions,
# treatment-emergent adverse events including overdose
# did not differ between treatment groups.

# In this population,
# it is more difficult to initiate patients to XR-NTX than to BUP-NX,
# and this negatively affected overall relapse.
# However, once initiated, both medications were equally safe and effective.
